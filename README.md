### How to run this app in Development

- Clone the project here: https://github.com/waldothedeveloper/g2i-trivia-challenge
- Once you have a local copy, install the dependencies (this will install all the dependencies of a create-react-app and other dependencies needed to run TailwindCSS on a create-react-app project.)
- With all the dependencies installed, run `yarn start` to run a development server on port 3000. You can also `yarn build` to build a production instance that can be served locally ( since this is using a cra project you can find all the info here: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/production-build)
